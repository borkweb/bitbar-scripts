# Customizing your Central BitBar

1. Copy `sections.sample.json` to `sections.json`
2. The key/value pairs correspond with sections that will load within the BitBar. To add a section, simply add a key/value pair.
3. Create your custom JSON files in `sections/` and change to your heart's content!
4. Feel free to nest things to your hearts delight - each nest parent should have the attribute "nested" set to true - see `tribe-central/sections-sample/repos.json` for an example.
